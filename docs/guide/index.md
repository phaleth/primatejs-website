# Guide

Welcome to the full guide to Primate. Ideally you'd have already made first
contact with Primate by reading the [getting started][getting-started] guide,
but you may equally well start here, as everything is explained.

Primate is not conceptually based on any existing framework and as such you
might come across ideas new to you even if you have worked with frameworks
before. Keep in mind that it was designed with many different *technical* goals
in mind, but one overarching idea: to let you concentrate on writing effective,
expressive code and abstract away annoying, repetitive tasks.

With that in mind, come aboard.
